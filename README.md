# 📦 PackTrack

PackTrack is a comprehensive logistics management system designed to track and route packages through various stages of their journey—from registration to delivery. Built using **Django** and **MySQL**, this project represents a complete full-stack solution tailored for customers, administrators, and transport drivers.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Developing **PackTrack** was a challenging and transformative journey that tested my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and perseverance. From configuring the development environment to designing complex database schemas and implementing full-fledged backend logic, every step involved continuous learning and refinement.

The final product is a powerful package tracking and routing solution that emphasizes automation, data integrity, and operational efficiency.

## 🛠️ Development Journey

### ⚙️ Environment Setup

Setting up the development environment was one of the most critical phases. Since the project required Django to work with MySQL, I configured MySQL on macOS using Homebrew. This process involved troubleshooting compatibility issues between Homebrew, Python, and Django versions. A major milestone was successfully installing and configuring the `mysqlclient` package to allow Django to communicate with the MySQL database.

---

### 🗃️ Database Schema Design

The schema was carefully crafted to model the logistics ecosystem. Key entities include:

- **Customers**
- **Packages**
- **Warehouses**
- **Transports**

To support dynamic package tracking, specialized tables were designed:
- `PackagesInSystem`
- `PackagesInTransit`
- `PackagesDelivered`

These ensured clear segregation of package states and efficient data handling. Establishing primary and foreign key relationships was essential for maintaining referential integrity.

---

### 🧠 Backend Development (Django)

The backend involved translating the schema into Django models and implementing business logic:

- CRUD operations for all major entities
- Automatic validation and constraints on data entries
- Logic to prevent overloading transports based on their capacity
- Integration with **MySQL triggers** to automate status updates and enforce business rules

---

### 👥 Role-Based Features

#### 🧑‍💼 Customers:
- Register packages with attributes like weight, dimensions, and pickup/drop-off locations
- Auto-populate entries in both `Packages` and `PackagesInSystem`

#### 🛠️ Admins:
- Assign packages to routes (dispatch, transfer, delivery)
- Dynamic admin interface with data-loaded dropdowns (warehouses, transports, etc.)

#### 🚚 Transport Drivers:
- Dashboard view of assigned routes
- Mark packages as delivered, damaged, or lost
- Archived delivery records and transition of packages to `PackagesDelivered`

---

### 🎨 Frontend Experience

The frontend was designed using **Bootstrap** and custom **CSS** to ensure:

- Responsive layout across devices
- Clean UI with dynamic dropdowns and action buttons
- User feedback via success/error messages for common actions

---

### 🧩 Key Challenges

- Syncing Django models with MySQL tables without migration conflicts
- Debugging schema-related errors (e.g., mismatched data types, broken foreign keys)
- Implementing real-time validation of transport load capacities
- Ensuring seamless transitions between package states (system → transit → delivered)

These challenges deepened my understanding of Django, MySQL, and full-stack problem-solving.
